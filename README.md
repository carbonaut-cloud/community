# Carbonaut Community

## Welcome to the Carbonaut community!

We are currently in the process of setting up the open source project. Watch this repository to track changes with updates on the community.

## Roadmap

The project roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/orgs/carbonaut/projects/1).
New initiatives for the roadmap will be marked as `roadmap-proposal` by a maintainer. A community decision will then be made as documented in [Decision Making](./governance-charter.md#decision-making).
